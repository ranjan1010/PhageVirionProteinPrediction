<p align="justify"> This site will help you to predict phage virion proteins (PVPs) from any phage protein
    sequences. Therefore, any user can submit protein sequences in FASTA format to get the prediction result
    for the same. Kindly find the below user guidelines for this site. </p>
<p align="justify"> <b>Step 1.</b> After clicking the site url. This site will redirect to Home page of this site.
    The home page is shown in the below figure. </p>

<p align="justify"> <b>Step 3.</b> The Submission page is shown in below figure. </p>
<img src="/static/img/SubmissionPage.png" width="900" height="500">
<p align="justify"> <b>Step 4.</b> In the Submission page user can submit phage protein sequence in two
    ways shown in red circles in the below figure.  </p>
<img src="/static/img/SubmissionPage1.png" width="900" height="500">
<p align="justify"> <b>Step 5.</b> If user doesnâ€™t have any phage protein sequence in FASTA format.
    User can click the <b>Example</b> button for sample of example sequences. The Example button is shown
    in below figure with a red circle.  </p>
<img src="/static/img/SubmissionPage2.png" width="900" height="500">
<p align="justify"> <b>Step 6.</b> If user clicked the Example button, then it will auto generate sample
    of phage protein sequences in the input text field. Now user has to click the <b>Submit</b> button shown in
    the below figure with a red circle. </p>
<img src="/static/img/SubmissionPage3.png" width="900" height="500">
<p align="justify"> <b>Step 7.</b> User also can choose the phage protein sequences FASTA file from
    his/her Computer, Mobile, Tablet etc..  The choose file option is shown in the below figure with
    a red circle. After choose the FASTA file from local system user has to click the <b>Submit</b> button
    shown in the same figure also with a red circle.   </p>
<img src="/static/img/SubmissionPage4.png" width="900" height="500">
<p align="justify"> <b>Step 8.</b> After clicking the <b>Submit</b> button user will redirect the result page.
    The result page will show the submitted phage protein sequences header name, prediction score and
    prediction class. The result page is shown in the below figure. </p>
