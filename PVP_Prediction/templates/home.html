<h1>Phage Reference Laboratory </h1>
<p align="justify">As per the recent reports, Anti-Microbial Resistance (AMR) is major problem
    an immediate alternative of antibiotics is a need of the hour.
    Research on possible alternative products to tackle infections is on-going worldwide.
    One of the most promising alternatives of antibiotics is the use of bacteriophage to cure
    bacterial infection caused by AMR bacteria. </p>
<p align="justify">Indian council of Medical Research (ICMR) has taken an initiative to work on Phage therapy.
    In this connection ICMR-National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases (ICMR-NICED), Kolkata
    is working on ICMR funded project entitled “Isolation and Characterization Diarrhea associated
    bacteriophages and their use in Phage Therapy” under the supervision of Dr. Alok Kumar Chakrabarti.
    One of primary objective of this project is to build a phage repository for India.
    Therefore, specific phage from this repository can be used for therapeutic purpose in future.</p>
<p align="justify"> This Phage Reference Laboratory of ICMR-NICED worked on different aspect of phage research.
    As per the recent reports, identification phage virion proteins (PVPs) not only helps us to
    understand the relationship between the phage and hosts, might also facilitate the development
    of novel antibacterial drugs. Therefore, we have developed a machine learning-based
    prediction method to predict PVPs using protein sequence composition features.
    We have employed well-known basic and ensemble machine learning methods with the aim of
    achieving nearly equal performance in both the training and independent sets.</p>
